## Why do we restructure, re-organise
### Deja Vu
We trained hard - but it seemed to me that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganised;
I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising;
**And a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress** while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralisation.
*Petronius Arbiter AD 66, Satyricon*


# Organisational Steps
- Design Jobs

- Group Jobs 
- Distribute authority
	- Design, organisational, structure
- Co-ordinate activities

## Three components
#### Complexity
- Departmental Principle -Breaking down of the organisation
- Span-of-control principle - A manager should control no more than a set amount of people (who are doing largely the same thing)
- Line-staff principle - line vs staff workers: Chefs vs Accountants in a Restaurant Both needed
- Scalar principle - there must be a clear line of authority
#### Formalisation (bureaucracy), Centralisation
# Organisational Structures
*Workplace HInt:* The informal structure may be as important as the formal. If the informal structure is the only way to "get things done", there is a problem.
#### Traditional
- Functional - grouped together based on the work they do
- Divisional - grouped together based on the product or service they provide
- Matrix - Permanent cross-functional groups 
#### New Developments - Mostly Come out of Software Development
- Team -  cross-functional teams, project teams and holocracies
- Network
