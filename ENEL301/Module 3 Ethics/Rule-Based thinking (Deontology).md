- Do the right thing (duty) 
- *An act is ethical if certain ethical rules are obeyed, regardless of the situation*
- This is an absolutist frame of mind
### Strengths:
- Simple to understand - If we follow the rules -> ethical else not.
### Weaknesses:
- Obey "Universal" laws?
	- It is wrong to kill innocent people
	- It is wrong to steal
	- It is wrong to tell lies
- Obey the "Word of god" - Which god
- Obey the law - The baseline
# What are the rules (Currently)

### Rule‐Based Thinking: Rules about Rights
Rule: People have fundamental rights that other people have a duty to respect (Rights Ethics) 
###### Examples:
- Free to consent (or not)
- Privacy
- Be told the truth
- Life and safety
- Freedom of choice
- Due process
- etc
###### The problem of conflicting rights
- Shortcomings
	- It is not always possible to simultaneously uphold the rights of all parties
- Conflicting rights can lead to ethical dilemmas
	- Right to free speech vs right to feel safe and respected
	- Right to privacy vs security
	- Right to community public health and safety vs free assembly (COVID-19)




### Rules about Justice
- Rule: Actions must be just and fair (Justice Ethics) 
	- Distributive Justice (Equity)
	- Procedural Justice (Impartiality)
	- Compensatory Justice (Fairness)
		- Not held responsible for actions they do not control
		- Compensation for injury by those responsible
- Shortcomings
	- Its not always possible to be "fair" to all involved


### Professional Codes of Ethics
- Rule: Follow your professional code of ethics 
###### All engineering professional bodies in Aotearoa NZ and internationally  have codes of ethics that all members must follow: 
- Engineering NZ Code of Ethical Conduct 
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Code of Ethics 
- ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics 
- IET (Institution of Engineering and Technology) Rules of Conduct (UK)  
- EngAust Code of Ethics and Guidelines on Professional Conduct (AUS) 
- RAE Statement of Ethical Principles (UK Royal Academy of Engineering) 
- ASCE Code of Ethics (American Society of Civil Engineers) 
- AIChE Code of Ethics (American Institute of Chemical Engineers) 
- ASME Code of Ethics (American Society of Mechanical Engineers)



- Rule: Follow the law 
- Rule: Obey “universal” laws 
### The Golden Rule 
- Rule: Treat others as you would wish to be treated (the  Golden Rule) 
	- "None of you \[truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself"<sub>40 Hadith Nawawi 13</sub>
	- "Do to others as you would have them do to you" <sub>Luke 6:31, Matthew 7:12</sub>
	- "This is the sum of Dharma \[duty]: do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you" <sub>Mahabharata 5:1517</sub>
- Shortcomings
	- Assumes your needs and wants are the same as others
	- Does not distinguish between competing stakeholders
**<big>Treat people the way THEY wish to be treated.</big>




	
### Company Policy
- Rule: Obey company/organisational policies
 - A requirement of your employment. Typical Aotearoa NZ engineering  company examples are: 
	 - WSP Opus  https://www.wsp.com/en‐US/who‐we‐are/corporate‐responsibility/ethics‐integrity 
	 - Meridian Energy  https://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/assets/Investors/Governance/Policies/Code‐of‐Conduct‐APPROVED‐27‐May‐2020.pdf 
	 - Fisher and Paykel Healthcare  https://www.fphcare.com/nz/our‐company/sustainability/ethics‐and‐legal‐compliance/

3. What are the types of justice in ethics? ::: Distributive (equity), procedural (impartiality), and compensatory (fairness). They deal with fair resource distribution, impartial processes, and injury compensation, respectively.
    
4. Name some engineering professional codes of ethics. ::: Examples include Engineering NZ Code of Ethical Conduct, IEEE Code of Ethics, and ASCE Code of Ethics, among others.
    
5. What is the Golden Rule in ethics? ::: It's the principle of treating others as you wish to be treated. However, it doesn't account for differing needs and wants.
