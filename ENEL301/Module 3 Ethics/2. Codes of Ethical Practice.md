## Professional Behaviour and Ethics
- Professionals
	- Are experts, and commit to stay expert
	- Use expertise responsibly for the greater good
	- Belong to a professional organisation of peers and follow its code of conduct
- Professionals **Obligations (duties)** do not depend on personal moral position
- A professional engineer must act ethically and abide by the ethical standards set by the profession as a whole
- The rationale is to identify and ensure competence and equity

# Obligations in the public interest
#### 1. Take reasonable steps to safeguard health and safety
You must, in the course of your engineering activities, take reasonable steps to safeguard the health and safety of people.
#### 2. Have regard to effects on environment
You must, in the course of your engineering activities,
i. have regard to reasonably foreseeable effects on the environment for those activities; and
ii. have regard to the need for sustainable management of the environment. In this rule, sustainable management means management that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations  to meet their own reasonably foreseeable needs.
#### 3. Report adverse consequences
If you have reasonable grounds to believe that an engineering matter has or could have, adverse consequences:

You must bring the matter to the notice of the relevant regulatory body, unless, having made inquiries, you are satisfied on reasonable grounds that the matter is being dealt with through an appropriate process or in an appropriate manor
#### 4. Act competently
###### You must:
- Ensure that your relevant knowledge and skills are kept up to date;
- Only undertake engineering activities that are within your competence;
- Undertake engineering activities in a careful and competent manner.
###### You must not:
- Misrepresent, or permit others to misrepresent, your competence;
- Knowingly permit other engineers for whose engineering activities you are responsible to:
	- undertake engineering activities that are outside their competence;
	- undertake engineering activities in a manner that is not careful and competent; 
	- misrepresent, or permit others to misrepresent, their competence.
#### 5. Behave appropriately
###### You must:
- Act with honesty, objectivity, and integrity;
- Treat people with respect and courtesy;
- Disclose and appropriately manage conflicts of interest
###### You must not:
- Offer or promise to give to any person anything intended to improperly influence a decision relating to your engineering activities;
- Accept from any person anything intended to improperly influence your engineering activities;
- Otherwise engage in, or support, corrupt practices.
#### 6. Inform others of the consequences of not following your advice
If you become aware that your professional advice may not be followed, 
and consider that a failure to observe that advice may have adverse consequences, 
you must inform the recipient of the advice of those adverse consequences.
#### 7. Maintain confidentiality

a) If you obtain confidential information from clients or  employers in the course of your engineering activities you:
- Must not use the information for any purpose other than the purpose in which the information was obtained
- Must not disclose the information unless the disclosure is permitted by this rule.

b) You may disclose confidential information if, and to the extent that:
- You are required to disclose the information in order to comply with [[2. Codes of Ethical Practice#3. Report adverse consequences|Rule 3]] or [[2. Codes of Ethical Practice#8. Report breach of code|Rule 8]] and you have first raised the matter with the person to whom confidentiality is owned;
- You are required by law;
- the information is publicly available;
- The disclosure is authorised by the person to whom confidentiality is owned
c) Information disclosed under 1st or 2nd bullet point may only be disclosed to those you are required to report it to (can report to ethical board but not your mates as well).
#### 8. Report breach of code
If you have reasonable grounds to believe that another Member has committed a significant breach of the Code of Ethical Conduct you must report the matter to Engineering NZ.

## When to whistleblow
- According to DeGeorge, whistleblowing is morally permissible when:
	- Threat to public is serious, considerable and imminent
	- Tried superiors first
	- Have exhausted other \[normal] internal channels
- Morally obligatory when:
- There is convincing documented evidence
- There is evidence that the act of whistleblowing will remove the threat
## How to whistleblow
###### IEEE Guidelines for Engineers Dissenting on Ethical Grounds 
1. Establish a clear technical foundation 
2. Keep your arguments on a high professional plane 
3. Try to catch problems early, and work with the lowest managerial level possible 
4. Make sure that the issue is sufficiently important
5. Use organisational dispute resolution mechanisms 
6. Keep records and collect paper 
7. Resigning
8. Anonymity 
9. Outside Resources
