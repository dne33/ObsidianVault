### The Person 
- **ethical values**
- Directly relate to personal beliefs
- **Non ethical values**
- Ethically **neutral**
- Relate not to **Morality** but to **desire**
- Pursuing non-ethical values is not wrong. **AS LONG** as it does not violate ethical values
### The Environment
**Ethics and the Law**
- Ethics: what a person ***ought*** to do
- Law: what a person is required to do by the state
	- Differs from country to country
- Law establishes **minimum standards of conduct**
	- Actions can be legal but not ethical
- Laws evolve with culture
### The Organisation 
**EngNZ Code of Ethical Conduct**
“The Code of Ethical Conduct sets out your  duty to the public and to each other when  you undertake engineering activities.  It gives you a decision‐making framework  for professional behaviour and is the  backbone of what it means to be a  professional engineer in New Zealand.”
