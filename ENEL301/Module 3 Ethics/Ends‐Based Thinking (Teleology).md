- Weigh competing actions according to their consequences
- *Acts are ethical when they achieve the **Best** outcome (Consequences)*
	- "The ends justifies the means"
-  Flexible not absolute unlike [[Rule-Based thinking (Deontology)]] 
##### Shortcomings: How to judge "Best" outcome
 - Best for me?
 - Best for my family?
 - Best for most people?
## Utilitarianism
- *Acts are ethical when they achieve the **greatest good for the  greatest number***
- "It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong" <sub>Jeremy Bentham 1776</sub>
	- Assess good and bad outcomes
	-  Consider the short and long term
	- Consider the "Good" for all effected stakeholders (yourself and others)
- Cost-benefit analysis
##### Shortcomings
- Only considers the overall happiness/suffering, not the distribution.
- Difficult to quantify emotive like happiness and suffering
