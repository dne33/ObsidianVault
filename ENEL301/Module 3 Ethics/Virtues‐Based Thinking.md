- *Acts are ethical if they are what **Virtuous** persons would do in the same circumstances.*
	- A virtuous person is what we consider a good person (honest, integral, has courage etc)
	- However, extremes are to be avoided (Aristotle's Golden Mean) too much courage -> recklessness and too little -> cowardice
- Shortcomings: Assumes everyone values the same virtues, and acts accordingly.
