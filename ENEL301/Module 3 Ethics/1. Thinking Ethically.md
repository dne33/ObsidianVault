### The Person 
- **ethical values**
- Directly relate to personal beliefs
- **Non ethical values**
- Ethically **neutral**
- Relate not to **Morality** but to **desire**
- Pursuing non-ethical values is not wrong. **AS LONG** as it does not violate ethical values
### The Environment
**Ethics and the Law**
- Ethics: what a person ***ought*** to do
- Law: what a person is required to do by the state
	- Differs from country to country
- Law establishes **minimum standards of conduct**
	- Actions can be legal but not ethical
- Laws evolve with culture
### The Organisation 
**EngNZ Code of Ethical Conduct**
“The Code of Ethical Conduct sets out your  duty to the public and to each other when  you undertake engineering activities.  It gives you a decision‐making framework  for professional behaviour and is the  backbone of what it means to be a  professional engineer in New Zealand.”

**Absolutist**

- **Do the right thing**
### [[Ends‐Based Thinking (Teleology)]] 
**Flexible**
- The belief that an act can be judged moral or immoral depending on its **consequences**
- **Do the most good (the ends justifies the means)**
### [[Virtues‐Based Thinking]]
**Absolutist**
- The belief that an act can be judged moral if the intent of the does is to act as a virtuous person
- **Be a good person**
### The “Prima Facie” Duties Framework
- Fidelity
	- Keep promises and don't tell lies
-  Reparation
	- fix wrong doings
