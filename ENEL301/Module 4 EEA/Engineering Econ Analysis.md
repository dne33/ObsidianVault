**Time value of money:**
 - A dollar today is worth more than tomorrow

## Cash flow diagrams as aids to problem solving
- CFDs are an easy way to visualise
- cash outflows as negative, inflows positive
- Cash during the year accrues to the end of the year
- point of view matters

## Interest vs Compounding interest:
i = interest rate
m = number of compounding periods in a year
t = time
**Static interest:**
FV = PV(1+i\*t)
**Compound:**
FV = PV(1+i/m)<sup>mt</sup> 

**Effective Annual Interest Rate:**
EAR= (1 + i/m)<sup>m</sup>-1

## Rates of return
- Interest Rates
- Opportunity Cost (r)
## Annuity
- An **Annuity** is a series of equally spaced, level cash flows that occurs over a finite number of periods
- Analysis assumes that there is a series of same-sized receipts or disbursements that begin at the end of period 1 and continue to the end of period n (aka the maturity date).
- Mortgage and loan payments are classical examples of annuity
