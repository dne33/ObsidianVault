- Be consistent in your treatment of inflation
	- A cash flow can be in real or nominal flows
	- If the cash flow is real, the discount rate must be real
- Cash flow is after tax
- When compraing cash flows, focus on the differences
- Consider all relevant criteria - Consider flow on effects 
- Be clear regarding uncertainty
	- How to treat risk
- Cash flow is not accounting profit!
- Sunk costs should be disregarded (from now onwards)
## Net Present Value
NPV = Sum(\[C/(1+r) for C in periodic_revenue])
E.G
proposed nuclear plant would cost $900 mil to build and generate $300 per year for 4 years. Then cost 90 mill to decomission in year 5
NPV of the project if the discount rate is 6% 
NPV = Sum(\[C/(1+r) for C in periodic_revenue])
       = -900 + 300/1.06 + 300/1.06<sup>2</sup> + 300/1.06<sup>3</sup> + 300/1.06<sup>4</sup> - 90/1.06<sup>5</sup> 
       = $72.278 Million
NPV of the project if the discount rate is 16% 
NPV = Sum(\[C/(1+r) for C in periodic_revenue])
       = -900 + 300/1.16 + 300/1.16<sup>2</sup> + 300/1.16<sup>3</sup> + 300/1.16<sup>4</sup> - 90/1.16<sup>5</sup> 
       = -$103.396 Million
