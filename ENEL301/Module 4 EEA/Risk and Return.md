Diversification - Good
More risk = higher return 
Less risk = less return
## Return on Capital
Two basic sources of capital for an enterprise:
- **Equity** capital - from owners of the business
- **Debt** capital - from lenders to the business
Providers of capital (debt or equity) need to decide whether expected return on capital justifies the risk inherent in being involved.
Interest or profit available from an alternative investment is called the **Opportunity cost** of using the capital in the proposed undertaking (^)

## Risk, Return and the Cost of Capital
- Investing in equity is riskier than investing in debt ...
- For large companies the cost of capital is the weighted average of the cost o borrowing (debt) and the cost of selling shares (raising equity)
- If the company is not seeking funding, it can set its own **Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return** (MARR) based on the **Opportunity cost of capital**
- For smaller companies, both debt and equity are harder to find, and cost more.
## Inflation: Converting rates
i<sub>real</sub> = real interest rate
i<Sub>nom</Sub> = nominal interest rate
infl = inflation rate
Fisher Equation:
1 + i<sub>real</sub> = (1 + i<Sub>nom</Sub>)/ (1 + infl)
- An estimate: 
	- Real interest rate â‰ˆ nominal interest rate - inflation rate
