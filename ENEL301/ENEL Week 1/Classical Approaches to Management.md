## 1. Scientific Management

Overview:  Engineering the most efficient production methods and improving the worker.
1. Develop a science for each element of the job to replace old rule-of-thumb methods
2. Scientifically select employees and then train them to do the job as described ^
3. Supervise employees to make sure they follow the prescribed methods for performing their jobs
4. Continue to plan work  but use workers to actually get the work done

## 2. Administrative Management
You've improved the job and improved the worker from using scientific management
Now its time to **Improve the Manager**
#### Henri Fayol (1841-1925)
- 5 Duties of Management
	- Foresight, Organisation, Command, Coordination, Control
##### 14 Principles of management.
1. Subordination of individual interest - Company interest > Individual interest, for everyone from CEO to worker
2. Equity - All employees should be treated equally and respectfully.
3. Workforce stability - An employee delivers the best if they feel secure in their job.
4. Initiative - Management should support and encourage initiative to help increase motivation and morale
5. Esprit de corps - Solidarity, developing trust and mutual understanding between workers and managers
6. Division of labour - More efficient if workload is segregated (technical and managerial)
7. Authority & Responsibility - There should be a balance between both 
8. Discipline - Worker Discipline makes management easier and helps workers build and progress
9. Unity of Command - Only one boss to negate conflict of interest
10. Unity of Direction - One goal and motive makes work easier 
11. Centralisation - Management or any authority responsible for decisions should be neutral.
12. Scalar chain - Chain of command evident and everyone knows their direct senior.
13. Remuneration - Make clear what you are being payed for
14. Order - Orderly placement of resources (manpower, money, materials) in the right place at the right time
#### Chester | Barnard (1886 - 1961)
- Formal vs Informal Organisations -> Formal = Uni, Work etc, Informal = Study Groups, Groups that form organically inside an organisation
	- Difficulties arrive when the goals of the Informal != Formal Orgs
- Acceptance theory of authority
	- The only authority a superior has is the authority that the workers give to their superior.
	- e.g: If whole class did not turn up for any assessments the whole class likely wouldn't fail the whole course (Lecturer/Course Coordinator replaced, interventions etc)

## 3. Bureaucratic Management
Improving the **Organisation**
#### Max Weber (1864 - 1920)
 - Clear division of labour
 - Clear hierarchy of authority
 - **Careers based on merit**
 - Formal rules and procedures
 - Impersonality

## Behavioural (HR) Management Approach
### The Mayo Studies (Elton Mayo)
- Illumination studies - Workers increased productivity as a fancy new yorker had come to study them.
- Relay Assembly Studies - Workers got bored and if not restricted would often keep trying new variations of assembly. (Often increasing productivity)
In both cases money not the cause of increased output.
Conclusions:
- Workers have needs other than money e.g Recognition, security, belonging.
- Intelligence is not restricted to management.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of needs
This can depend on culture...
### McGregor: Theory X & Y Managers
#### Theory X Managers Think:
The average human has an inherent dislike of work 
-> This leads to thinking people must be coerced, controlled, directed or threatened with punishment to get effort out of them
The average human being prefers to be directed, avoid responsibility, has relatively little ambition, wants security above all else [[Classical Approaches to Management#1. Scientific Management|Very much the scientific management approach]]
#### Theory Y Managers Think:
- Work is Natural - the avg person does not dislike it
- External control and threats are not the only means of bringing about effort towards orgs goals
- The avg person can learn not only to accept but seek responsibility
- The capacity for high imagination, ingenuity and creativity is widely not narrowly distributed in the population
- The intellectual properties of the avg person are only partially uitilised
-  Self-Actualisation approach.
