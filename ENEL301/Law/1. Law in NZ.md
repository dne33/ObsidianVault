# Contracts
## What is a contract?
- A contract may be defined as an agreement or set of promises between 2 or more persons that is intended to be enforceable at law.
- Key word is "Agreement" - there must be a mutual assent or understanding between the parties. (Agreement and consent)
## Elements of a contract
#### 1. Intention to create legal relations
 - Parties must intend that their agreement must be enforceable at law
 - Commercial agreements will normally give rise to such an intention
 - Social/domestic arrangements, such as between friends and family
#### 2. Offer and Acceptance
- Offer = "an expression of willingness to contract made with the intention that is will become binding on the person making it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed"\
- Acceptance = "A final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of the offer"
- Counter offer - Destroys the original offer and substitutes a new offer
###### Invitations to treat
- Invitations to make an offer
- A "Feeling" towards a contract - a preliminary step
- Not a promise to be bound if accepted but rather a signal of preparedness to negotiate entering a contract
- e.g. advertisements, catalogues, etc.

#### 3. Consideration 
 - Each party gives the other something and each party gets something in return
 - Must be sufficient (real and valuable)
 - But it **need not be adequate** (up to the parties to decide)
	 - e.g. money, goods, services, forbearances, and peppercorns.
	 - Peppercorn rental - pay one peppercorn per year for rental (purely nominal) - makes it contractual something in exchange
