# Contracts
## What is a contract?
- A contract may be defined as an agreement or set of promises between 2 or more persons that is intended to be enforceable at law.
- Key word is "Agreement" - there must be a mutual assent or understanding between the parties. (Agreement and consent)
## Elements of a contract
#### 1. Intention to create legal relations
 - Parties must intend that their agreement must be enforceable at law
 - Commercial agreements will normally give rise to such an intention
 - Social/domestic arrangements, such as between friends and family
#### 2. Offer and Acceptance
- Offer = "an expression of willingness to contract made with the intention that is will become binding on the person making it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed"
- Acceptance = "A final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of the offer"
- Counter offer - Destroys the original offer and substitutes a new offer
###### Invitations to treat
- Invitations to make an offer
- A "Feeling" towards a contract - a preliminary step
- Not a promise to be bound if accepted but rather a signal of preparedness to negotiate entering a contract
- e.g. advertisements, catalogues, etc.

#### 3. Consideration 
 - Each party gives the other something and each party gets something in return
 - Must be sufficient (real and valuable)
 - But it **need not be adequate** (up to the parties to decide)
	 - e.g. money, goods, services, forbearances, and peppercorns.
	 - Peppercorn rental - pay one peppercorn per year for rental (purely nominal) - makes it contractual something in exchange
#### 4. Capacity
Generally, legal persons have the capacity to contract
- Minors
	- A minor is a person who is under the age of 18
	- Contracts are unenforceable against minors, unless a court finds the agreement to be fair and reasonable.
	- Some contracts are always enforceable against minors: employment agreements, life insurance contracts and contracts that have been pre-approved by a court
- Intoxicated
	- If a person is so intoxicated they do not know what they are doing and this is appreciated by the other party then the contract is voidable by the first (intoxicated) person.
#### 5. Genuine Consent
- A party is the victim of unfair treatment if you can show their consent was given under either:
	- Duress - threats of physical damage
	- Undue influence - domination of the mind
- Or there is:
	- Unconscionably - poverty, illiteracy, illness that has been taken advantage of;
	-  Mistake/Misrepresentations that induce the contract - reliance upon statements that are not true.
#### 6. Legality
- Contracts may be void for reason of illegality
	- Contrary to a statute
	- Contract to commit a crime, tort, fraud
	- Contracts that interfere with the administration of justice
- May technically breach a statute but may be remedied by the court if both parties unaware
###### Exclusion of liability
- Some contracts attempt to exclude liability for contract breach in some situations
	- These will usually be effective - unless involves a consumer transaction
- Some contracts attempt to exclude liability for misrepresentation
	- These will be effective if fair and reasonable in the circumstances
# Negligence
- Private law: not publlic/criminal
- Is a species of "Tort"
- Essentially - caused harm to the plaintiff without cause or excuse.
- Other torts include defamation, breach of privacy and nuisance
- In NZ - for personal injury -> ACC
##### Definition

## Key elements to negligence
1. Duty of care owed - person is a 'Neighbour' 
2. Breach of duty - failed to reach the standard of care a reasonable person ought to have
3. Breach causes loss/damage 
# Consumer Protection
- Fair trading act provides **Pre-sale** protection by regulating promotional conduct (adverts,brochures, etc)
- The consumer guarantees act provides **Post-sale** protection, i.e after the sale of goods or provision of services when the consumer has used them
