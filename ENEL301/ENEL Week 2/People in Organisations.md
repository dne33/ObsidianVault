## Process Theories
#### J Stacy Adams **Equity Theory**
- Employees try to maintain equity between inputs and outcomes compared to others in similar situations
- Beware - equity judgements are based on perceptions.
![[Pasted image 20230804095601.png|500]]
- Workplace tip: Most people find it difficult to make equity judgements between themselves and others.
## Expectancy Theory
#### Victor Vroom
Before Committing effort to a task, employees ask
- Can I accomplish the task? (Expectancy)
- If I do accomplish it, what is the reward? (instrumentality)
- Is it worth? (Valence)

## Goal Setting Theory
*Management Report: Could consider  this for leadership prompt*
#### Motivational leaders:
 - Set Specific Goals
 - Set Challenging goals
 - Build goal acceptance and commitment
 - Clarify goal priorities
 - Provide feedback on goal accomplishment
 - Reward goal accomplishment
## Reinforcement Theory
- Based on behaviour modification (operant conditioning)
	 - Operant Conditioning = Reward & Punishment for good/bad behaviour (to encourage/discourage)
- Types:
	- Positive reinforcement
	- Neg reinforcement - Do the required thing no negative outcome
	- Punishment - If you do the bad thing you will get punished
	- Extinction -If you do the bad thing you will lose the reward you prev had
- Note effect of reinforcement schedule
	- Continuous vs intermittent
		- Continuous - The subject just got used to it
		- Intermittent -  The subject is much more motivated as it does not know when it will happen.
