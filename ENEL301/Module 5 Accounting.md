## Accounting Equation
- **Total Assets** = Total liabilities + Total Owners' Equity
- **Shareholder's Equity**  = Contributed Capital + Retained Surplus (Left over profit)
- **Retained Surplus** = Net Profit after Tax - Distributions (to Owners)
- **Net Profit after Tax** = Revenue - Expenses
- **Working Capital** = current assets - liabilities
