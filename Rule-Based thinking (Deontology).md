- Do the right thing (duty) 
- *An act is ethical if certain ethical rules are obeyed, regardless of the situation*
- This is an absolutist frame of mind
### Strengths:
- Simple to understand - If we follow the rules -> ethical else not.
### Weaknesses:
- Obey "Universal" laws?
	- It is wrong to kill innocent people
	- It is wrong to steal
	- It is wrong to tell lies
- Obey the "Word of god" - Which god
- Obey the law - The baseline
# What are the rules (Currently)
- Rule: Follow the law 
- Rule: Obey “universal” laws 
### Rule‐Based Thinking: Rules about Rights
Rule: People have fundamental rights that other people have a duty to respect (Rights Ethics) 
###### Examples:
- Free to consent (or not)
- Privacy
- Be told the truth
- Life and safety
- Freedom of choice
- Due process
- etc
###### The problem of conflicting rights
- Shortcomings
	- It is not always possible to simultaneously uphold the rights of all parties
- Conflicting rights can lead to ethical dilemmas
	- Right to free speech vs right to feel safe and respected
	- Right to privacy vs security
	- Right to community public health and safety vs free assembly (COVID-19)




### Rules about Justice
- Rule: Actions must be just and fair (Justice Ethics) 
	- Distributive Justice (Equity)
	- Procedural Justice (Impartiality)
	- Compensatory Justice (Fairness)
		- Not held responsible for actions they do not control
		- Compensation for injury by those responsible
- Shortcomings
	- Its not always possible to be "fair" to all involved

- Rule: Treat others as you would wish to be treated (the  Golden Rule) 
- Rule: Follow your professional code of ethics 
- Rule: Obey company/organisational policies
