# Evidence Based Software Engineering
#### Software Engineering sub-discipline focusing on using evidence to
- Evaluate SE solutions
- Support and improve decision making 
### Evidence
- Statistical
- Experimental
- Surveys or literature reviews

## How to produce evidence?
Empirical studies can be:
- Quantitative:
	- Does a cause-effect relationship exists
	- Is there an associations between factors
- Qualitative
	- To assess the causes and effects of the behaviour of software developers and managers
- Observational
	- Based on measurements or surveys of a sample without trying to affect them
- Experimental
	- Sub-groups with on baseline and a 'treatment' for other groups
- Systematic literature reviews
	- Thorough analysis of literature
- Systematic mapping study
	- Lightweight analysis of literature
## Limitations of empirical methods
- Internal
	- Factors that may affect the validity of the causal relationship between treatment and outcome
- External
	- Are the results generalisable to the intended population of interest
- Construct
	- How well the outcomes of the study are linked to the concepts or theory behind the study
