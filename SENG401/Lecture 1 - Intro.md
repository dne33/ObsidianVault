## high-quality software is:
#### Internal Qualities 
- Well documented (user documentation and technical documentation)
- Well-structured/decomposed/architected 
- No code duplication (reuse) 
#### External Qualities
- Meets users' expectations (needs, functional requirements) 
- Does not fail unexpectedly 
- Has no bug 
- High performance, reactive 
- Ergonomic/easy to use/intuitive
## Software development life cycle (SDLC)
Definition: 
- Process to transform user requirements -> high quality software.
Described as a sequence/set/graph of phases, such as:
- Requirements specification
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing/Verification & validation
- Deployment/Delivery
SDLC types give a template; the name and number of phases may be adapted in a specific project.

### Objectives of SDLC
- Reduce time-to-market
- Improve product quality
- Reduce product cost
*Improving quality* **increases (immediate) cost and time-to-market**
