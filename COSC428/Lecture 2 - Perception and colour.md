## Simplified rendering models
### Reflectance
Often are more interested in relative spectral composition than in overall intensity so the spectral BRDF computation simplifies a wavelength-by-wavelength multiplication of relative energies.
### Transmittance
The degree in which light can pass through a medium. Useful for imaging through materials like glass, water, or fog. Involves techniques such as image dehazing or enhancement.
