## Simplified rendering models
### Reflectance
Often are more interested in relative spectral composition than in overall intensity so the spectral BRDF computation simplifies a wavelength-by-wavelength multiplication of relative energies.
### Transmittance
The degree in which light can pass through a medium. Useful for imaging through materials like glass, water, or fog. Involves techniques such as image dehazing or enhancement.

## The Human Eye
**Spectral Resolution:** 400 (violet) -> 700 nm (red)
**Dynamic Range:** ~10<sup>8</sup>:1
**Spatial Resolution:** ~ 1-3cm @ 20cm
**Radiometric Resolution: ** ~ 16-32 shades B&W,  ~ 100 colours

### Rods and Cones
##### Cones
**C**ones see **C**olour
- RGB
~6.5 Million Cones
- R-74% G-10% B-16%
High Res
Light adapted vision is called photopic
Shorter and thicker than rods
##### Rods
Rods don't see colour
~100 Million
May be excited by a single photon
Respond to higher frequencies (B/G)
Peripheral and night vision
Dark-Adapted is called scotopic
The rods are long slender receptors
