## Difficulties in vision computing
### The sensory gap
 - The gap between the object in the world and the information in a description derived from a recording.
 The goal of the shape-from-contour module is to derive information about the orientation of the various different faces.
### The semantic gap
- Lack of coincidence between information from visual data 
- The higher the level of interpretation, the more domain knowledge and management are required.

### Taking the Human Visual System for Granted
Human visual systems are very good. The subtlety and difficulty of describing exact operation of the subconscious functions presents significant difficult in developing algorithms to emulate human visual behaviour.
## How Do We Recover 3-D Information?
There are number of cues available in the visual stimulus 
 - Motion
 - Stereo 
 - Texture
 - Shading
 - Contour
 - Time of flight
 Each of these cues relies on background assumptions about physical scenes in order to provide unambiguous interpretation.
